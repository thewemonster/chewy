# chewy

**A silly little utility I made to learn some Rust**

### install

```sh
# clone the repo
➜ git clone https://github.com/thewemonster/chewy
# go into the directory
➜ cd chewy
# build the program
➜ cargo build
```
### basic usage

```sh
Usage: chewy [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -p, --path <PATH>    (Optional) Path to file that contains email addresses
  -u, --username-only  (Optional) Boolean value indicating output should only render the usernames including the delimeter
  -d, --domain-only    (Optional) Boolean value indicating output should only render the domains
  -h, --help           Print help information
  -V, --version        Print version information
```

### future development

Looking forward to continue learning Rust. I'd like to implement some better error handling and find ways to be more efficient. If you have suggestions, let me know!
